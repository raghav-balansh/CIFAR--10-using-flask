# ðŸ“¸ CIFAR-10 CNN with Flask Deployment: Your Image Classification Web App
This project builds a web application for image classification using a CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### What it does:

Accurate Image Recognition: Identify objects in uploaded images with a trained CNN model.<br>
User-Friendly Interface: Interact seamlessly with the web application built using Flask.<br>
Instant Predictions: Get class labels for your images the moment you upload them.<br>

### Getting Started:
Install required libraries: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
Download CIFAR-10 data: ```python from tensorflow.keras.datasets.cifar10```<br>
Run the Flask application: `python app.py` in terminal.<br>
Access the web app: `127.0.0.1:5000`<br>
